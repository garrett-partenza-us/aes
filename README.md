# AES from Scratch in Pure Python ### *(Okay maybe Numpy too)*

This repository contains an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard in Python. The goal of this project was to (1) increase my understanding of the most popular symmetric encryption algorithm through implementing it, and (2) to refresh my fluency in Numpy due to a recent Javascript hiatis. Also it was raining in Fort Lauderdale this weekend so I could not spearfish, so if I can't catch fish I may as well catch exceptions.
