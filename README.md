# AES from Scratch in Pure Python

*Okay maybe I used Numpy too*

This repository hosts an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Python. The project serves two primary purposes: firstly, to deepen my comprehension of this widely used symmetric encryption algorithm by developing it from scratch, and secondly, to reacquaint myself with Numpy after a recent JavaScript hiatus. Additionally, it rained in Fort Lauderdale over the weekend, and I figured if I cant catch fish I might as well catch some exceptions.
